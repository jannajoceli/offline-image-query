# Offline Image Query and Extraction Tool

Offline Image Query and Extraction Tool serves the study of visual content for social or media research but it is not limited to this purpose. It allows researchers to use the image name file as query, helping them to navigate visual content according to its different characteristics, such as:

* Image query according to user accounts or link domains (the site of image creation or appearance) 
* Image query according to engagement metrics, e.g. shares, comments, views, likes, re-tweets, etc. (the site of image audiencing)
* Image query according to computer vision outputs, e.g. labels, top-level link domains, web entities, not safe for work content, etc. (the content of the image itself or sites of image circulation)
* Image query according to a period of time, e.g. hours, days, months, years

This tool was created as a response to the short life of online image URLs, allowing researchers to explore and analyse specific collections of images on demand. 

Technically, the tool locates image files scattered in nested and sparse directories by filename, copies them to a new location and then inserts labels as prefixes to the image filenames.

The tool supports Windows, mac OS and Linux.
